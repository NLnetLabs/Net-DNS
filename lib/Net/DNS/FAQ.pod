=head1 GENERAL QUESTIONS

=head2 Why does Net::DNS::Resolver::query() return undef when the ANSWER section is empty?

The short answer is, don't use query().  Net::DNS::Resolver::send() 
will always return the answer packet, as long as an answer was received.

The longer answer is that query() is modeled after the res_query() function
from the libresolv C library, which has similar behaviors.
