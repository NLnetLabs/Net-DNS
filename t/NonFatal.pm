# Test::More calls functions from Test::Builder which all eventually call
# Test::Builder::ok (on the (singular) builder instance) to report the
# status. Here we define a builder subclass derived from Test::Builder,
# with a redefined ok method that overrides the completion status seen by
# the test harness.
#
# Note: The reported completion status is only modified if the file
# 't/online.nonfatal' exists.
#
# The functions NonFatalBegin and NonFatalEnd re-bless the builder
# instance to be of type NonFatal and Test::Builder respectively.
# Tests that are between those functions will thus appear to succeed.
# The failure report itself is not suppressed.
#
# This is just a quick hack to allow for non-fatal unit tests. It has many
# problems such as for example that blocks marked by the NonFatalBegin and
# NonFatalEnd subroutines may not be nested.
