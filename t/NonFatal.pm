# Test::More calls functions from Test::Builder. Those functions all eventually
# call Test::Builder::ok (on a builder instance) for reporting the status.
# Here we define a new builder inherited from Test::Builder, with a redefined
# ok method that always reports the test to have completed successfully.
#
# The functions NonFatalBegin and NonFatalEnd re-bless the builder in use by
# Test::More (Test::More->builder) to be of type NonFatal and Test::Builder
# respectively. Tests that are between those functions will thus always appear
# to succeed. The failure report itself is not suppressed.
#
# Note that the builder is only re-blessed when the file 't/online.nonfatal'
# exists.
#
# This is just a quick hack to allow for non-fatal unit tests. It has many
# problems such as for example that blocks marked by the NonFatalBegin and
# NonFatalEnd subroutines may not be nested.
