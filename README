1. DESCRIPTION
--------------

Net::DNS is a Perl interface to the DNS resolver.  It allows the
programmer to perform any type of DNS query from a Perl script.
For details and examples, please read the Net::DNS manual page.

To read about the latest features, see the Changes file.  To find
out about known bugs and to see what's planned for future versions,
see the TODO file.

As of version 0.02, Net::DNS is written entirely in Perl.  Version
0.01 was written mostly in C and used the system's resolver.  The
Perl version runs quite a bit slower, but considering that the
network can be a serious bottleneck when making DNS queries, the
speed difference may not really matter in most cases.  However,
future versions may contain some C to increase speed or for those
who wish to link against libresolv or libbind.

The author invites feedback on the module, particularly at this
early stage of its development.  If there's something you'd like
to have added, please let me know.  If you find a bug, please send
me the information described in the BUGS section below.


2. AVAILABILITY
---------------

You can get the latest version of Net::DNS from the Comprehensive
Perl Archive Network (CPAN) or from the author's homepage:

    http://www.perl.org/CPAN/modules/by-module/Net/
    http://www.dimensional.com/~mfuhr/perldns/

The following links will redirect your browser to the current
released version and the current working (i.e., not released)
version, respectively:

    http://www.dimensional.com/~mfuhr/perldns/Net-DNS-release.tar.gz
    http://www.dimensional.com/~mfuhr/perldns/Net-DNS-current.tar.gz


3. PREREQUISITES
----------------

Net::DNS requires the following:

    Perl 5.003
    IO-1.15

Net::DNS may work with earlier versions of the above, but the author
hasn't tested this.  The latest versions can be obtained from CPAN:

    http://www.perl.org/CPAN/

Some of the demonstration and contributed scripts may require
additional modules -- see demo/README and contrib/README for details.


4. INSTALLATION
---------------

Please install any modules mentioned in the PREREQUISITES section
above.  If you don't, Net::DNS won't work.  When you run "perl
Makefile.PL", Perl should complain if any of the required modules
are missing.

To build this module, run the following commands:

    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test
    make install


5. RUNNING TESTS
----------------

If any of the tests fail, please contact the author with the output
from the following command:

    make test TEST_VERBOSE=1

If you examine the test scripts (in the t/ directory), you'll notice
that there aren't many tests for the resolver itself (i.e., the
network code).  Part of the problem is creating a test suite to
work on systems both with and without Internet connectivity.  Future
versions of this module may have more tests but will probably
require some site-specific configuration before running them.

The author does run additional tests against customized zone data
on a private nameserver, but these tests aren't included in the
distribution.


6. DEMONSTRATION SCRIPTS
------------------------

There are a few demonstration scripts in the demo/ directory -- see
demo/README for more information.  Contributed scripts are in the
contrib/ directory -- see contrib/README.

The author would be happy to include any contributed scripts in
future versions of this module.  All I ask is that they be documented
(preferably using POD) and that the contributor's name and contact
information be mentioned somewhere.


7. DYNAMIC UPDATES
------------------

   *** WARNING: THIS CODE IS NOT READY FOR PRODUCTION USE ***

Net::DNS now supports DNS dynamic updates as documented in RFC 2136;
for more information and an example, please see the Net::DNS::Update
manual page.

The dynamic update code is still under development but I've decided
to make it available to those who'd like to try it; please see the
TODO file for some of the things I still need to work on.  At this
time, I recommend that you don't use Net::DNS to maintain a production
nameserver via dynamic updates.

Please note that there are some bugs in the BIND 8.1-REL nameserver
that can cause it to dump core when receiving certain dynamic
updates, so if you have problems using Net::DNS that might be the
cause.  I recommend using BIND 8.1.1 or later.

Here's a summary of the update semantics for those interested (see
RFC 2136 for details):

    PREREQUISITE SECTION
                   # RRs   NAME   TTL   CLASS   TYPE   RDLENGTH   RDATA
                   -----   ----   ---   -----   ----   --------   -----
    yxrrset          1     name    0     ANY    type       0      empty
    yxrrset          1+    name    0    class   type   rdlength   rdata
    nxrrset          1     name    0     NONE   type       0      empty
    yxdomain         1     name    0     ANY     ANY       0      empty
    nxdomain         1     name    0     NONE    ANY       0      empty


    UPDATE SECTION
                   # RRs   NAME   TTL   CLASS   TYPE   RDLENGTH   RDATA
                   -----   ----   ---   -----   ----   --------   -----
    add RRs          1+    name   ttl   class   type   rdlength   rdata
    del RRset        1     name    0     ANY    type       0      empty
    del all RRsets   1     name    0     ANY     ANY       0      empty
    del RRs          1+    name    0     NONE   type   rdlength   rdata


8. BUGS
-------

  *** THIS VERSION OF Net::DNS IS FOR TESTING AND STILL CONTAINS BUGS ***

Net::DNS is still in its early stages and is sure to contain a few
bugs.  Please see the TODO and Changes files for more information.

As mentioned in the Dynamic Updates section above, I don't recommend
using Net::DNS to maintain a production nameserver via dynamic
updates unless you've tested it *thoroughly*.  This author takes no
blame if you corrupt your zone.

If you find a bug, please report it to the author along with the
following information:

    * version of Perl
    * version of Net::DNS
    * version of IO
    * operating system type and version
    * version of nameserver (if known)
    * exact text of error message or description of problem
    * the shortest possible program that exhibits the problem
    * the specific queries you're making, if the data is available
      to Internet nameservers

If I don't have access to a system similar to yours, I may ask you
to insert some debugging lines and report back on the results.
The more help and information you can provide, the better.
